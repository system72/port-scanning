# port-scanning

hello guys in this repository I am using python 2.7 again but this time with a different little twist. In this folder is a file that can be used to scan for open ports on a system.  

NOTICE: This program is not to be used for illegal purposes, I will not be held responsible for anything that you do with this program.

Now that we have this out of the way feel free to copy my program and maybe try it out on your computer. It does take a while to run but it will print out a file with all the open ports of your scaned host.
